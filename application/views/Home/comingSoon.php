                                    <h3>Why <span class="idea-word">Idea</span><span class="lab-word">Lab</span></h3>
                                    <p class="flow-text">IdeaLab was borne out from a collective narrative of different stories that fell into place: long night talks of reform by quiet members of a student political party, the underground movement of independent students who are fed up of being gagged by the present system in USC, and just now, the cry for a Colorless SSC. People from different walks of life converging together towards a single advocacy—change. </p>
                                    <p class="flow-text">It is now apparent that people are hungry for change. Marc Ong’s election was not by accident: for the first time in more than ten years since SPP was established, Carolinians have elected a majority president. And for more than ten years, voter turnout has surpassed the 40 per cent threshold. However, the challenge that we face today is how to move change from being a noun to a verb. To paraphrase Joel Barker, the vision must turn into action in order to change the world; otherwise, a vision without action is just a dream. </p>
                                    <p class="flow-text">The vision in IdeaLab is simple: to provide a hub for Carolinians to incubate real and passion-filled advocacies so that we can contribute in producing servant leaders who put service above politics, service above positions, and service above recognitions. We want you to feel comfortable with the idea that you can make a difference without having to earn a position. All you need is an idea and a group of people to help you enable that idea into reality.</p>

                                    <p class="flow-text">IdeaLab serves an incubator for student-led initiatives and advocacies. Implementing a project or starting an advocacy campaign requires the right idea with the right attitude.</p>

                                    <p class="flow-text">To get to the right idea, our fellows have to seriously reflect whether they are passionate about their ideas and whether it is something the Carolinian community can embrace. Fellows who are admitted into IdeaLab will face a semester-long Ideation program where they are exposed to different types of ideas, initiatives and advocacies. During weekends, we’ll invite speakers around Cebu and across the Philippines to share their passion stories about their advocacies, organize small TED talk sessions where our fellows listen, reflect and discuss what they’ve heard, conduct an inventory on the situation and needs of the Carolinian community, and provide personal mentors who can guide you through the whole process of incubating your ideas.</p>

We would to galvanize the identity of a Carolinian Warrior—as advocacy-driven servant leaders. As quiet revolutionaries for change, servant leaders are aware of their capabilities and potentials, who have a long-term vision of what they advocacies to grow and become, who are stewards committed to serve their constituents of their chosen advocacies first, and who yearn to build a diverse Carolinian community. During the weekends, fellows will pass through a series of formation modules, team building exercises, small group workshops, and fellowship activities in order to form the right attitude and perspective in pursuing their chosen advocacies.</p>

                                    <p class="flow-text">After a semester of ideation and leadership formation, fellows undergo a semester-long fellowship program. The program is divided into two tracks: the volunteer and facilitation fellowship programs. Before the start of the succeeding semester, fellows must already choose a particular project that matches with their interests and advocacies.</p>

Working together with a mentor and their partners, they will undergo the process of planning the project, acquiring the human and financial resources needed, organizing the logistics and implementation, and evaluating the prospect of the program’s sustainability. Volunteer fellows will have a semester to accomplish the project. At the end of the program, we expect our volunteers to become independent-minded and initiative-driven advocates.</p>

Working together with mentors and with the support of partner organizations, they will organize a series of student consultations, forums, and caravans, research on the general awareness of student sentiments, launch charitable campaign events, and produce online campaign materials. Facilitator fellows will have a semester to accomplish the campaign. At the end of the program, we look forward for our facilitators to have a deeper appreciation and understanding of the issues they wish to advocate.</p>

The project may be a proposal they have initially submitted in their applications, a new idea they have discovered while undergoing ideation, or a scaled-up version of the projects they interned in. Fellows will have a year to implement their projects. IdeaLab and its partner organizations can provide an initial seed fund to help them kick start their projects.</p>

He called for student leadership that goes beyond party colors. His story was your story—a story about change, about hope, about being inspired to redefine the scope of Carolinian student leadership and to redesign a clearly flawed system in student governance.</p>
                                    <p class="flow-text">In this exercise, we would like you to dig deep into your holistic experience as a person. Try to go back as far into your childhood, replay those experiences and try to put together the dots. Try to build those experiences until it has converged to where you are now, reading this kit and thinking about your leadership story.</p>
                                    <p class="flow-text">What we would like you to do is to build a nonlinear timeline of your leadership story (see the example below). Why chart your leadership story in a nonlinear way? It’s because how things fall in place isn’t exactly straightforward. For example, some experiences way back in the past that may not have been connected with a series of events may actually be influencing your decisions now.</p>
