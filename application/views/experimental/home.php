              <h1>Why IdeaLab?</h1>
              <p>
                IdeaLab was borne out from a collective narrative of 
                different stories that fell into place: long night talks of 
                reform by quiet members of a student political party, 
                the underground movement of independent students who are 
                fed up of being gagged by the present system in USC, and 
                just now, the cry for a Colorless SSC. People from different 
                walks of life converging together towards a single advocacyâ€”change.
